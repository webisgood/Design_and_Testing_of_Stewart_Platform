# Design, Fabrication, and Testing of a Stewart Platform

In this project, we as a group of four designed and fabricated a Stewart Platform from scratch. We used ball-screw joints for the six legs of the platform, servo motors for controlled motion of these legs, and an Arduino UNO to program the way in which the servo motors are controlled to perform a specific trajectory.
